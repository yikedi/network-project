    - Sends RETR and can deal with 
      - failure on remote side
      	(should close the data connection)
      - local file open failure
      - unexpected closure of data channel
    - actual transfer of file data
    - binary files are properly transferred

dir command                                           [0/5]
    - Sends PASV and opens connection specified in response
    - Can handle error response or connection failure
    - Sends LIST and can deal with  (2)
      - failure on remote side
      	(should close the data connection)
      - unexpected closure of data channel
    - actual transfer of directory listing is correct

Format of output conforms to that specified in assignment    [/4]
   - in particular lines are identified with --> and <--
   - Only data from the control connection prints the <--, printed
     data on the data connection does not contain <-- 
   - the contents of the data connection are only printed for the dir 
     command, get and put do not print what is sent or 
     received on the data connection. 

Error processing                                        [/2]
   - handles unexpected closure of control connection
   - handles unexpected EOF when reading command lines


Parameters: properly handles multiple spaces or tabs    [/2]

Broad Marking Criteria :                     [7/9] 
See the assignment section on edX for a description of the broad marking 
criteria and what we were looking for. Note: this criteria was made available
at the same time as the assignment description. 

     Readability        [/3]
     Code Documentation [2/3]
     Code Quality       [2/3]


   

MARKER'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Trying to keep methods smaller.
More comments for large blocks of code
----------- Non Functional Criteria

Readability

       3 marks - Code is "clean", understandable and well organized,
        with no issues.  
       2 marks - There may be minor issues with
        consistency of identation and use of white space. variable
        naming or general organization. Although annoying, this does
        not have a major impact on readability.  
       1 mark - There are major issues with indentation, whitespece,
        variable naming 0 marks - There are major problems across
        multiple categories with respect to readability  

Documenting your code

     3 marks  - Code is well and completely commented    

     2 marks - One or two places could benefit from some additional
               comments to add clarity to what is being done.
     
     1 mark - Multiple locations where sections of code are
              uncommented or comments aren't helpful 

      0 marks - Few or no helpful comments

Code Quality

     3 marks  - Uniformly good choices of algorithms and data
                structures across all aspects of the solution

     2 marks - Good choice of algorithms or data structures except
               for 1 or 2 situations where some improvement is possible

     1 mark - Poor algorithms or data structure choice in multiple
              situations and major improvement is possible.

     0 marks - Consistently poor algorithm and data structure choices.
